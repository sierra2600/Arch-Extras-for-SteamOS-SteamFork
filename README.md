# Arch-Extras-for-SteamOS-SteamFork
This is a specialized script for when
you're unable to locate a package for
your Linux SteamOS/SteamFork install,
once the said package is installed, this
script WILL REMOVE ITSELF FROM EXISTANCE
as tinkering too much in another realm
that is not SteamOSs/SteamForks already
existing mirrors could have potential of
someone having a bad day

(This is currently geard towards
SteamFork as I'm not sure if SteamOS
has zenity at the moment)
